## INTRODUCTION

The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. It is therefore good to know the performance of your supermarket and areas that you need to improve for it to better. 


I analyse a dummy supermarket dataset with the following attributes in sql:
*  **Invoice id**: Computer generated sales slip invoice identification number
* **Branch**: Branch of supercenter (3 branches are available identified by A, B and C).
* **City**: Location of supercenters
* **Customer type**: Type of customers, recorded by Members for customers using member card and Normal for without member card.
* **Gender**: Gender type of customer
* **Product line**: General item categorization groups - Electronic accessories, Fashion accessories, Food and beverages, Health and beauty, Home and lifestyle, Sports and travel
* **Unit price**: Price of each product in $
* **Quantity**: Number of products purchased by customer
* **Tax**: 5% tax fee for customer buying
* **Total**: Total price including tax
* **Date**: Date of purchase (Record available from January 2019 to March 2019)
* **Time**: Purchase time (10am to 9pm)
* **Payment**: Payment used by customer for purchase (3 methods are available – Cash, Credit card and Ewallet)
* **COGS**: Cost of goods sold
* **Gross margin percentage**: Gross margin percentage
* **Gross income**: Gross income
* Rating**: Customer stratification rating on their overall shopping experience (On a scale of 1 to 10)

Thousands of people visit supermarkets every day to buy food and housing supplies. By analyzing this data, we can learn more about customer preferences regarding payment methods, visiting times, and membership in loyalty programs — based on location or gender. Then, we can adjust every single supermarket to increase customer satisfaction and profits.

I analysed this dataset in Microsoft SQL Server.
